# Python_Project-Bank_loan
Bank Loan Analysis using Python — explores customer loan data to identify approval trends, risk factors, and insights for better decision-making.

# Overview
This project focuses on analysing bank loan data using Python in Jupyter Notebook.
The goal is to understand loan approval trends, identify key factors affecting loan status, and support data-driven lending decisions.

# Objectives
•	Analyze customer demographic and financial data. <br>
•	Identify patterns in loan approval and rejection. <br>
•	Evaluate relationships between income, loan amount, credit history, and loan status. <br>
•	Provide actionable insights to improve loan eligibility predictions. 

# Key Insights
•	Applicants with a good credit history have a higher approval rate. <br>
•	Applicant income and loan amount strongly influence loan eligibility. <br>
•	Self-employed individuals tend to have more loan rejections due to inconsistent income sources.

# Project Structure
•	Dataset: <a href= "https://github.com/Pranali-6yp/Python_Project-Bank_loan/blob/main/financial_loan.csv" </a>      <br>
•	Jupyter notebook:<a href="https://github.com/Pranali-6yp/Python_Project-Bank_loan/blob/main/Bank%20loan%20analysis.ipynb" </a>

# Results
•	Data visualization highlights approval trends across different applicant categories. <br>
